# Hack Computer

This repo contains the WIP implmentation of the Hack Computer based on the book "Elements of computing systems 2nd edition".

Constuction of the computer is divided into two parts:-
1. Hardware System
2. Software System

## The Hardware System contains the below implementations:-
- [ ] Elementary logic gates like NOR, AND, NOT, OR, etc implemented in a Hardware description language.
- [ ] ALU chip for performing calculations based on input bits.
- [ ] Memory ciruits like RAM for storing bits.
- [ ] A Computer architecture for realizing the Hack computer. 


## The Software System contains the below implementations:-

- [x] A HackAssembler for translating Assembly programs to 16-bit words that can run on the Hack computer.
- [x] A VM translator for translating VM code to Assembly.
- [x] A Compiler for the Jack programming language which generates VM(Virtual machine) code.
- [ ] JackOS containing key algorithms/libraries for memory management, mathematical operations, graphics, string and array support written in Jack.
- [ ] A Tetris game written in Jack that runs on top of the Hack computer.
- [x] A Tic Tac Toe game written in Jack that runs on top of the Hack computer.
