# Hack Computer

This repo contains the WIP implmentation of the Hack Computer based on the book "Elements of computing systems 2nd edition".

Constuction of the computer is divided into two parts:-
1. Hardware System
2. Software System

## The Hardware System contains the below implementations:-
- [ ] Elementary logic gates like NOR, AND, NOT, OR, etc implemented in a Hardware description language.
- [ ] ALU chip for performing calculations based on input bits.
- [ ] Memory ciruits like RAM for storing bits.
- [ ] A Computer architecture for realizing the Hack computer.
- [x] An Assembler program for translating assembly programs to bits that can run on the Hack machine. 


## The Software System contains the below implementations:-

- [x] A two tier compiler for the jack programming language which runs on the 16-bit Hack computer.  
- [ ] JackOS containing key algorithms and libraries for memory management, mathematical operations, etc.
- [ ] A Tetris game written in jack that runs on top of the Hack computer.
